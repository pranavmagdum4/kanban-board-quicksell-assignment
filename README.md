# kanban-board-quicksell-assignment

This React JS application interacts with the API available at [Quicksell API](https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment). It allows users to adjust the Kanban board dynamically based on their grouping and sorting preferences. Tickets can be grouped by status, user, or priority, and sorted by priority or title. The application also ensures that the user's view state is preserved even after a page refresh.

## Features

- **Organize tickets** by status, user, or priority.
- **Arrange tickets** based on priority or title.
- **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Persistent view settings**: The user's view state is saved in local storage, so it remains consistent after page reload.
- **Priority Levels**: Tickets are categorized by urgency, where:
  - Urgent: 4
  - High: 3
  - Medium: 2
  - Low: 1
  - No Priority: 0

## Tech Stacks

- **HTML**: Used to structure the application.
- **CSS**: Adds styles and enhances the look of the interface.
- **JavaScript**: Provides dynamic functionality and interactive features.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building fast and reusable UI components.
